## INTRODUCTION


         
         Recently the global pandemic caused by COVID-19 has
urged people to create contactless devices so that the further spreading
of the disease can be stopped. So by keeping in view such situations, we
have created a contactless doorbell and the idea behind making the
doorbell is that itâ€™s the most frequently used device in every house which
can be effective in spreading the virus and germs.
To make this doorbell, we have used a distance sensor by
giving a minimum distance to detect the object/hand of the visitor.
When the person is standing within the defined range of
distance, a signal is initiated from the sqadron board which in turn
initiates to ring the buzzer and the led glows.

## OBSERVATION



          *The ultrasonic sensor contains a receiver and a transmitter and operates at a
voltage of 5 volts.
          * When the transmitter sends a signal, and if the object/body is present in the
defined range of length ( 15-20 cm) from the sensor, the signal is reflected and
is received by the receiver of the sensor .
          * The LED glows and the buzzer produces sound on interpreting the signal
and hence acts as a contactless doorbell.
          * If the signal is not reflected back, it implies that no object/body is present
in the vicinity of the sensor and hence the LED does not glow and the sound is
not produced by the buzzer.
