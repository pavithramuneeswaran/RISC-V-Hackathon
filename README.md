## INTRODUCTION


        Recently the global pandemic caused by COVID-19 has
urged people to create contactless devices so that the further spreading
of the disease can be stopped. So by keeping in view such situations, we
have created a contactless doorbell and the idea behind making the
doorbell is that it’s the most frequently used device in every house which
can be effective in spreading the virus and germs.
To make this doorbell, we have used a distance sensor by
giving a minimum distance to detect the object/hand of the visitor.
When the person is standing within the defined range of
distance, a signal is initiated from the sqadron board which in turn
initiates to ring the buzzer and the led glows.

## OBSERVATION
      *The ultrasonic sensor contains a receiver and a transmitter and operates at a
voltage of 5 volts.
* When the transmitter sends a signal, and if the object/body is present in the
defined range of length ( 15-20 cm) from the sensor, the signal is reflected and
is received by the receiver of the sensor .
* The LED glows and the buzzer produces sound on interpreting the signal
and hence acts as a contactless doorbell.
* If the signal is not reflected back, it implies that no object/body is present
in the vicinity of the sensor and hence the LED does not glow and the sound is
not produced by the buzzer.
